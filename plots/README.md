- Figure 1. Stacked bar chart visualizing the artefact category (typology_class_2) distribution in the weapon dataset. The labels show the total number of artefacts counted for the respective category. The fill colour of the bars indicates the proportion of the artefacts with or less precise typological dating information.

- Figure 2. Map of the macro areas of the archaeological site of Olympia. The background is a site map prepared by the DAI's Athens Department. The fill colour indicates the total number of weapon artefacts documented per area.

- Figure 3. Map plot matrix showing the diachronic development of the weapon distribution (cf. Figure 2) in steps of 10 years from 800 to 400 BC (-800 to -400). The time slot between 1000 and 800 BC is not plotted because of the very small amount of weapon artefacts from this period (cf. Figure 6). For the calculation of the underlying time series, the aoristic weight correction was not applied. Instead, artefacts were counted in each timestep overlapping with the dating range of said artefact. The number of displayed artefacts therefore exceeds the actual amount of artefacts due to multiple counting (cf. fig. 6/7).

- Figure 4. Ridge plot with the temporal distribution of the main artefact categories (typology_class_2). The time series were calculated with aoristic weight correction. The labels on the left gives the total number of artefacts. Compared to Figure 1, the data for this figure was filtered more thoroughly and therefore the total numbers are smaller. The dot under each ridge shows the centre point of the distribution and the vertical order of categories from bottom to top follows the order of the center points in time.

- Figure 5. More detailed ridge plot of the temporal artefact category distribution (cf. Figure 4). The plot is based on typology_class_2, typology_class_3, and typology_class_4. Only categories represented by â‰¥ 10 artefacts are shown in this plot.

- Figure 6. Plot panel with four plots. A: Time series of all weapon artefacts between 1000 and 400 BC both with and without the aoristic correction. The black line is skewed by multiple counting (cf. Figure 3) and therefore labelled a "Maximum number of artefacts". B: Time series based on the temporal attribution of the artefact categories selected for Figure 5. The smooth yellow line is a fitted spline (R function stats::smooth.spline()). C: First derivative of the spline from B. D: Sequence of decade-wise Euclidean distance based on the absolute number of artefacts for the categories in Figure 5. Each decade-decade distance is represented by a colour coded stripe. Points and line show the cumulative sum of the distance values.

- Figure 7. Plot panel with three plots. A: Barplot of the dated and typologically classified weapon artefact categories that are part of the Greek panoply. Shield related artefacts are split up into meaningful subcategories, to visually mitigate multiple counting. B: Schematic drawing of the ancient Greek panoply. C: Normalized ridge plot of the aoristic weight for the panoply related categories. The jittered scatter plot below each ridge is one (!) possible iteration of this distribution sampled from the artefact age ranges.
