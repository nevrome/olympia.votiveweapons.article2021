Graells R., Schmid C., ... Workingtitle 2019

### Abstract:

...

### Keywords: 

Olympia, Bronze Age, ...

### Overview of contents:

This repository contains the directories `code` and `data` to reproduce the preparations, calculations and figure renderings in this paper. The `plots` directory contains readily rendered versions of the plots.

### How to reproduce:

As the data and code in this repository are complete and self-contained, it can be reproduced with any R environment (\> version 3.5.0). The necessary package dependencies are documented in the `DESCRIPTION` file and can be installed manually or automatically with `devtools::install()`. If it’s not possible any more to construct a working environment with these methods due to technological progress, one can use the Docker image.

A Docker image is a lightweight GNU/Linux virtual computer that can be run as a piece of software on Windows, Linux, and OSX. To capture the complete computational environment used for this project we have a Dockerfile that specifies how to make the Docker image that we developed this project in. The Docker image includes all of the software dependencies needed to run the code in this project, including the data and code itself. To launch the Docker image for this project, first, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) on your computer and download the `.tar` file with the paper image [here](...) (not yet available). At the Docker prompt, you can load and run the image with:

    docker load -i olympiavotiveweapons19_docker_image.tar
    docker run -e PASSWORD=olympia -dp 8787:8787 --name olympiavotiveweapons19 olympiavotiveweapons19

This will start a server instance of RStudio. Then open your web browser at localhost:8787 or run `docker-machine ip default` in the shell to find the correct IP address, and log in with **rstudio/olympia**. Once logged in, use the Files pane (bottom right) to navigate to the script files. More information about using RStudio in Docker is available at the [Rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org) [wiki](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Using-the-RStudio-image) pages.

We developed and tested the package on this Docker container, so this is the only platform that we’re confident it works on. It was built and stored with:

    docker build -t olympiavotiveweapons19 .
    docker save -oolympiavotiveweapons19_docker_image.tar olympiavotiveweapons19
